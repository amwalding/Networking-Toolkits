# Windows Networking Toolkit and Linux Networking Toolkit
My Windows and Linux Networking Toolkits batch file/script and bash file.

The WinNetToolkit_vX is the Windows version of my toolkit.  This is a batch file.
NetToolkit for Linus is as it says - for Linux.  This is a bash file.

Well folks, I have decided to make these toolkits available to all. You can take them here or...

Download the Windows one here on GitHub or here: https://www.cellstream.com/2024/02/17/our-windows-networking-toolkit/
Complete instructions for the Windows tool kit are available here: https://www.cellstream.com/2024/03/08/usage-instructions-for-our-windows-networking-toolkit/ 

Download the Linux code here on GitHub or here: https://www.cellstream.com/download/linux-networking-toolkit/
I have not created a complete instruction for the Linux toolkit.

As you can see, it has just about everything you need. Let me know if you would like to see something added.


**Update**
Working an a Linux equivalent BASH file.  This is currently a work in progress.
