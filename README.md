# WinNetToolkit
My Windows Networking Toolkit batch file/script.

This is a Windows only batch file.
Well folks, I have decided to make this toolkit available to all. Just download it here: https://www.cellstream.com/2024/02/17/our-windows-networking-toolkit/
Complete instructions are available here: https://www.cellstream.com/2024/03/08/usage-instructions-for-our-windows-networking-toolkit/ 

If you work in networking and you have to use a Windows machine, it is literally impossible to memorize all the networking commands. I have written numerous articles discussing some of the features in the toolkit. You can peruse and find these articles here.

What is our Toolkit? It is a little executable that runs only on Windows systems in the command line space. It is a menu driven program that will execute a bunch of very desirable networking focused commands. Here is the primary interface:
